### React Quiz App

This project is a dynamic quiz application built with React. It was initially created as a practice project while learning about React Router, but has since been expanded with additional features and components as well as refactoring the code to use context API. 

This project is based on The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Redux & More offered by Udemy. The original code was provided by Jonas Schmedtmann.

### Features

**Dynamic Question Loading:** The application fetches quiz questions from an external API (https://opentdb.com/), providing a different quiz experience each time.

**Progress Tracking:** The application tracks and displays the user's progress through the quiz, including the current question number and score.

**Start Screen:** Before starting the quiz, users can select the difficulty level and category of the questions.

**Loading State:** While fetching questions from the API, the application displays a loading state to keep the user informed.

**High Score Tracking:** The application keeps track of the user's high score across multiple quiz sessions.

### Learning Outcomes

This project served as a practical application of several React concepts, including React Router for managing different views, the useReducer hook for state management, useEffect for side effects such as fetching data from an API and using React Context API to manage state and clean up prop. It also provided experience with asynchronous JavaScript and error handling.

### Future Improvements
Future improvements could include adding more customization options for the quiz, such as the number of questions, and more advanced score tracking.
